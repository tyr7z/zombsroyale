*Zombs Royale* (officially: *ZombsRoyale.io*) is a 2D battle royale video game developed by an American studio, [End Game](https://end.gg/). It was released on 2018 for iOS, Android and on web browsers. Most of the new development projects focus on creating programs that interoperate with Zombs Royale (such as a bot or server).

## Documentation

There are ongoing efforts to keep reverse engineered documentation updated, but it isn't as easy as it sounds. The protocol generally changes slightly with each update and often things get rearranged. In the navigation menu are links to the current documentation segments, which may or may not be completely up to date.
