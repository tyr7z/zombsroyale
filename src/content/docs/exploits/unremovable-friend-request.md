title: Unremovable Friend Request
description: An old exploit allowing the creation of unremovable friend requests and accounts with no numbers

## Introduction

The "Unremovable Friend Request" exploit was initially discovered in late 2020 by a user known as **Saad**. At the time, the vulnerability was not widely known, yet the development team was able to patch it within a week. Despite this, existing unremovable friend requests have remained persistent in the system.

## Technical breakdown of the original exploit

The vulnerability stemmed from improper handling of **friend-code string lengths** in the game's backend. Specifically:

-   Users could set a `friend_code` value that was **excessively long**, causing a **buffer overflow** in the friend system.
-   This overflow resulted in the **removal of the identifier suffix** (e.g., `username#1234` → `username#`), thereby corrupting the internal representation of the user tag.
-   If the overflow was **too large**, the system failed to process the friend-code, yet still allowed it to send friend requests.
-   These requests became **unremovable and unconfirmable** on the recipient's side, effectively leaving them in a persistent, unmanageable state.

### Artifact

:::note
If the overflowed `friend_code` was within a certain threshold—short enough to be stored but long enough to strip the identifier—it could result in an account with **no numeric tag**, a rare artifact of the exploit. There are only few known accounts like this (as the ones shown in the images). It is estimated to be less than 25 of such accounts.

## Patch & mitigation measures

The exploit was mitigated shortly after its discovery through a **server-side input validation**:

-   A **length constraint** was introduced on the friend-code update request, effectively preventing overflow conditions.
-   It is unclear whether any additional backend modifications were implemented to harden the system against similar future vulnerabilities.

## Current status and future

As of writing this, the server-side check has been effective for over five years. However:

-   In **2023**, a new bypass method was privately rediscovered, but has not been publicly disclosed.
-   This updated method has only been shared among **trusted individuals**, and the developers remain unaware of its existence.
-   Given the developers' historical response time, a **silent patch** could be expected once the new bypass becomes known internally.
