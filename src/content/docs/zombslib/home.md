This is the official documentation for [zombslib](https://github.com/creaffy/zombslib). The library is currently **private**, we'll make it public at some point in the future.<br/>

## Credits

Zombslib was inspired by [Zombs.io Client Library](https://github.com/particle99/zombs-client-library-ts). Make sure to check it out if you're interested.<br/>
The rest of the credit goes to us, the group of reverse-engineers behind figuring out the protocol and making it all work - **xor&pray**.<br/>

## Purpose

This project is intended to lay the foundation for all future ZR network-based projects. It is supposed to be a minimal library focused on delivering an easy-to-use **Codec Reimplementation** and **Artificial Player Controller API** with little to none extra features in order to stay clean and reliable.
